# Retail Analytics Dashboard Project

## Overview
  This project analyzes transactional retail data to uncover trends in revenue,
  order behavior, product performance, and returns. The goal was to build
  executive-ready dashboards in both Power BI and Tableau.

## **Online Retail Dataset**  
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

This dataset contains transactional retail sales data, including invoice numbers,
product codes and descriptions, quantities, prices, customer IDs, and countries.
It is commonly used for analytics, customer behavior analysis, and revenue modeling.

## Tools Used
  - Power BI (Power Query, DAX, data modeling, dashboards)
  - Tableau (interactive dashboards, actions, storytelling)
  - Python (pandas, pyodbc) for data ingestion and transformation
  - SQL Server (LocalDB) for transactional data storage
  - Excel (initial raw data source)

## Key Business Questions
  - How does revenue trend over time?
  - Which invoice values dominate customer behavior?
  - Which products drive disproportionate revenue and volume?
  - How significant are returns?

## Deliverables
  - Power BI Interactive Dashboard
  - Tableau Public Story
  - Cleaned analytical dataset

## Live Dashboards
- Tableau Public: https://public.tableau.com/views/KalichTyler_RetailAnalyticsProject/Story1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
- Power BI Service: Power BI Service publishing is unavailable due to school-tenant restrictions.
The full interactive report is available via the Power BI Desktop (.pbix) file.

## Key Insights
  - Nearly half of all invoices fall between $100–$499.
  - A small cluster of products drives a disproportionate share of revenue.
  - Return rate is ~9.4%, materially impacting net revenue.

## What I’d Improve Next
  - Customer segmentation
  - Time-series forecasting
  - Cohort analysis
